Logicalty adds brand new items for boring items that don't have any recipes
Also adds new content that is wacky and just plain fun!

I am talking about the Acorns, Starfishes, shells etc

Now these items finally have some useful weapons/items/accessories for them

0.2.6.1 
- removed illegal sprites from the mod, will be updated with new ones asap!

Over 70+ Items already!

There are currently 1 new NPC, 36 weapons, 10 tools, 4 accessories, 1 new hat, 2 new blocks, 1 new furniture, 1 new biome, 2 enemies and 3 new buffs in the mod and more will be added as times goes on:

More items will be added daily!
